    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chole Bhature is a popular North Indian dish consisting of spicy chickpea curry 
        (chole) served with deep-fried bread (bhature). The chickpea curry is made with 
        a blend of aromatic spices, onions, tomatoes, and cooked until thick and flavorful. 
        Bhature, a soft and fluffy fried bread, pairs perfectly with the spicy chole and 
        is often enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or lunch.
