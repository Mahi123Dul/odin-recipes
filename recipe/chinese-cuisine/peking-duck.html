        Peking Duck is a famous Chinese dish that originated in Beijing. It is prized for its crispy 
        skin and succulent meat. The duck is traditionally prepared by marinating it in a mixture of 
        spices, drying it, and then roasting it until the skin is golden and crispy. Peking Duck is 
        typically served with thin pancakes, scallions, cucumber, and hoisin sauce.
