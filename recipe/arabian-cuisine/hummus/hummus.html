    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Hummus is a delicious and creamy dip made from mashed chickpeas, tahini (sesame paste), lemon juice, 
        garlic, and olive oil. It's a staple in Middle Eastern cuisine and is often served as an appetizer or 
        snack with pita bread, crackers, or vegetables. Hummus is not only tasty but also packed with protein, 
        fiber, and healthy fats, making it a nutritious addition to any meal.
