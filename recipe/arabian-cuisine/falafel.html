    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Falafel is a popular Middle Eastern dish made from ground chickpeas or fava beans, mixed with herbs, 
        spices, and onion, then formed into balls or patties and deep-fried until golden and crispy. It's 
        often served in pita bread or as part of a mezze platter with tahini sauce, salad, and pickles. 
        Falafel is not only delicious but also vegetarian and gluten-free, making it a versatile and 
        satisfying option for everyone.
