    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern street food made with thinly sliced marinated meat (often 
        lamb, chicken, or beef) stacked on a vertical rotisserie and grilled to perfection. The grilled 
        meat is typically served wrapped in pita bread or flatbread, along with a variety of toppings 
        such as tahini sauce, hummus, pickles, and fresh vegetables. Shawarma is known for its bold 
        flavors and satisfying texture, making it a favorite among food enthusiasts worldwide.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the thinly sliced chicken thighs or lamb/beef to the marinade, ensuring that the meat is well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Thread the marinated meat onto skewers and grill for 5-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked and slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Remove the grilled meat from the skewers and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it thinly.</li>
        <li>Warm the pita bread or flatbread on the grill or in the oven. Place a generous amount of sliced meat in the center of each piece of bread.</li>
        <li>Top the shawarma with tahini sauce, hummus, pickles, sliced vegetables, or any other desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Roll up the bread tightly to enclose the filling and serve the shawarma hot, with extra sauce and toppings on the side.</li>
    </ol>
