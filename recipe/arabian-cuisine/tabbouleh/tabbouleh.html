    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tabbouleh is a refreshing Middle Eastern salad made from bulgur wheat, fresh herbs, and 
        vegetables, tossed in a zesty dressing of olive oil and lemon juice. This salad is light, 
        flavorful, and packed with nutrients, making it a perfect side dish or light meal. Tabbouleh 
        is traditionally served cold and is a staple in Lebanese cuisine, often enjoyed as part of a 
        mezze spread or alongside grilled meats and kebabs.
